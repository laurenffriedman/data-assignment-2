<h1>People Who Suffer the Most From Migraines May Be Less Likely to Get Treatment</h1>
<h2>Migraines are common, affecting nearly 1 in 6 Americans. But many of the people who experience them have their pain dismissed or undertreated.</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1806702/">most accounts</a>, people have been plagued by the debilitating pain of migraine headaches for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8904749/">thousands of years</a>. But unlike the many diseases that have been eliminated by vaccines and better sanitation, migraines are still very much with us—especially some of us.</p>
<p>Migraines involve not only pain, which can last for hours or days, but also often nausea, vomiting, and a heightened sensitivity to light and sound. They are among the most common neurological disorders, affecting nearly 1 in 6 U.S. adults, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33349955/">data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>Women have long been much more likely to experience migraines than men. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02867-4">Some research suggests</a> that estrogen itself may be a potent trigger, with many women at an elevated risk for a migraine at a particular point in their menstrual cycle. But women are also less likely to be properly treated for all kinds of pain, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396897 ">research showing</a> that physicians are less likely to thoroughly investigate the cause of women’s pain and more likely to dismiss it as psychological in origin.</p>

<p>Migraines are also much more common among people living in poverty; people making less than $35,000 a year are 57 percent more likely to experience migraines than people making $100,000 or more.</p></div>

    <p> The reasons why are complicated and not fully understood. Though it's possible that the stresses of poverty could trigger migraines, an alternate explanation is plausible too, writes Rebecca Burch, a neurologist at the Graham Headache Center at Harvard Medical School, in an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33349955/">analysis of the CDC data</a>: "Given the well-recognized disability associated with migraine it is also possible that migraine may interfere with completion of education and maintenance of employment."</p>
    <p>What's more, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33349955/">research has found</a> that people without insurance are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for migraines and more likely to receive care in the emergency department, rather than from a primary care provider or a specialist. The disparities in migraine treatment may be especially acute now, Burch writes, as more effective—and much more expensive—treatments for migraine have recently become available.</p>
